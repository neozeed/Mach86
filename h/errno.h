/*
 *  This error number is used internally to short-circuit standard system call
 *  processing which uses the namei() routine.  When namei() determines that a
 *  valid remote name access has been made, it directly calls the remote system
 *  call code itself to process the call.  Upon returning to its caller,
 *  however, it must return a failure indication to prevent the system call
 *  from being processed any further locally.  This error number (along with an
 *  inode pointer of NULL) is used to accomplish this.  It is recognized
 *  specially by the system call handler and cleared before completing transfer
 *  of control back to the user process.
