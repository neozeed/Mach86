/*
 * Primitive routines for operating on sockets and socket buffers
 */

/*
 * Procedures to manipulate state flags of socket
 * and do appropriate wakeups.  Normal sequence from the
 * active (originating) side is that soisconnecting() is
 * called during processing of connect() call,
 * resulting in an eventual call to soisconnected() if/when the
 * connection is established.  When the connection is torn down
 * soisdisconnecting() is called during processing of disconnect() call,
 * and soisdisconnected() is called when the connection to the peer
 * is totally severed.  The semantics of these routines are such that
 * connectionless protocols can call soisconnected() and soisdisconnected()
 * only, bypassing the in-progress calls when setting up a ``connection''
 * takes no time.
 *
 * From the passive side, a socket is created with
 * two queues of sockets: so_q0 for connections in progress
 * and so_q for connections already made and awaiting user acceptance.
 * As a protocol is preparing incoming connections, it creates a socket
 * structure queued on so_q0 by calling sonewconn().  When the connection
 * is established, soisconnected() is called, and transfers the
 * socket structure to so_q, making it available to accept().
 * 
 * If a socket is closed with sockets on either
 * so_q0 or so_q, these sockets are dropped.
 *
 * If higher level protocols are implemented in
 * the kernel, the wakeups done here will sometimes
 * cause software-interrupt process scheduling.

/*
 * Socket buffer (struct sockbuf) utility routines.
 *
 * Each socket contains two socket buffers: one for sending data and
 * one for receiving data.  Each buffer contains a queue of mbufs,
 * information about the number of mbufs and amount of data in the
 * queue, and other fields allowing select() statements and notification
 * on data availability to be implemented.
 *
 * Data stored in a socket buffer is maintained as a list of records.
 * Each record is a list of mbufs chained together with the m_next
 * field.  Records are chained together with the m_act field. The upper
 * level routine soreceive() expects the following conventions to be
 * observed when placing information in the receive buffer:
 *
 * 1. If the protocol requires each message be preceded by the sender's
 *    name, then a record containing that name must be present before
 *    any associated data (mbuf's must be of type MT_SONAME).
 * 2. If the protocol supports the exchange of ``access rights'' (really
 *    just additional data associated with the message), and there are
 *    ``rights'' to be received, then a record containing this data
 *    should be present (mbuf's must be of type MT_RIGHTS).
 * 3. If a name or rights record exists, then it must be followed by
 *    a data record, perhaps of zero length.
 *
 * Before using a new socket structure it is first necessary to reserve
 * buffer space to the socket, by calling sbreserve().  This commits
 * some of the available buffer space in the system buffer pool for the
 * socket.  The space should be released by calling sbrelease() when the
 * socket is destroyed.
 *
 * The routines sbappend() or sbappendrecord() are normally called to
 * append new mbufs to a socket buffer, after checking that adequate
 * space is available, comparing the function sbspace() with the amount
 * of data to be added.  sbappendrecord() differs from sbappend() in
 * that data supplied is treated as the beginning of a new record.
 * Data is normally removed from a socket buffer in a protocol by
 * first calling m_copy on the socket buffer mbuf chain and sending this
 * to a peer, and then removing the data from the socket buffer with
 * sbdrop() or sbdroprecord() when the data is acknowledged by the peer
 * (or immediately in the case of unreliable protocols.)
 *
 * To place a sender's name, optionally, access rights, and data in a
 * socket buffer sbappendaddr() should be used.  To place access rights
 * and data in a socket buffer sbappendrights() should be used.  Note
 * that unlike sbappend() and sbappendrecord(), these routines check
 * for the caller that there will be enough space to store the data.
 * Each fails if there is not enough space, or if it cannot find mbufs
 * to store additional information in.
