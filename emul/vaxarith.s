 #	vax-11 instruction emulator
 #
 # abstract:
 #
 #	the routines in this module emulate the vax-11 packed decimal
 #	instructions that perform arithmetic operations. these procedures can
 #	be a part of an emulator package or can be called directly after the
 #	input parameters have been loaded into the architectural registers. 
 #
 #	the input parameters to these routines are the registers that
 #	contain the intermediate instruction state. 
 #
 # environment: 
 #
 #	these routines run at any access mode, at any ipl, and are ast 
 #	reentrant.

 #	v01-003 ljk0037		Lawrence j. kenah	17-jul-1984
 #		Fix two minor bugs in exceptions handling code that caused
 #		MULP and DIVP tests to generate spurious access violation
 #
 #	v01-002	ljk0024		lawrence j. kenah	21-feb-1984
 #		add code to handle access violations. perform minor cleanup.
 #		eliminate double use of r10 in mulp and divp.
 #
 #	v01-001	ljk0008		lawrence j. kenah	19-oct-1983
 #		the emulation code for addp4, addp6, subp4, subp6, mulp and
 #		divp was moved into a separate module.

 # symbol definitions

 #	the architecture requires that r4 be zero on completion of an addp6 or 
 #	subp6 instruction. if we did not have to worry about restarting 
 #	instructions after an access violation, we could simply zero the saved 
 #	r4 value on the code path that these two instructions have in common 
 #	before they merge with the addp4 and subp4 routines. the ability to 
 #	restart requires that we keep the original r4 around at least until no 
 #	more access violations are possible. to accomplish this, we store the 
 #	fact that r4 must be cleared on exit in r11, which also contains the 
 #	evolving condition codes. we use bit 31, the compatibility mode bit 
 #	because it is nearly impossible to enter the emulator with cm set.

 # rather than totally confuse the already complicated logic dealing with
 # different length strings in the add or subtract loop, we will put the
 # result into an intermediate buffer on the stack. this buffer will be long
 # enough to handle the worst case so that the addition loop need only concern
 # itself with the lengths of the two input loops. the required length is 17
 # bytes, to handle an addition with a carry out of the most significant byte.
 # we will allocate 20 bytes to maintain whatever alignment the stack has.

 # the number of minus signs will determine whether the real operation that we
 # perform is addition or subtraction. that is, two plus signs or two minus
 # signs will both result in addition, while a plus sign and a minus sign will
 # result in subtraction. the addition and subtraction routines have their own
 # methods for determining the correct sign of the result. 
 # 
 # for the purpose of counting minus signs, we treat subtraction as the
 # addition of the negative of the input operand. that is, subtraction of a
 # positive quantity causes the sign to be remembered as minus and counted as
 # a minus sign while subtraction of a minus quantity stores a plus sign and
 # counts nothing.

 # functional description:
 #
 #	this routine takes two packed decimal strings whose descriptors
 #	are passed as input parameters, subtracts one string from the
 #	other, and places their sum into another (perhaps identical) 
 #	packed decimal string.
 #
 #	at the present time, the result is placed into a 16-byte storage
 #	area while the difference is being evaluated. this drastically reduces
 #	the number of different cases that must be dealt with as each
 #	pair of bytes in the two input strings is added.
 #
 #	the signs of the two input strings have already been dealt with so
 #	this routine performs subtraction in all cases, even if the original
 #	entry was at addp4 or addp6. 
 #
 # input parameters:
 #
 #	r0<4:0> - number of digits in first input decimal string
 #	r1      - address of least significant digit of first input 
 #		  decimal string (the byte containing the sign)
 #
 #	r2<4:0> - number of digits in second input decimal string
 #	r3      - address of least significant digit of second input 
 #		  decimal string (the byte containing the sign)
 #
 #	r4<4:0> - number of digits in output decimal string
 #	r5      - address of one byte beyond least significant digit of 
 #		  intermediate string stored on the stack

 #
 #	(sp)	- saved r5, address of least significant digit of ultimate
 #		  destination string.
 #	4(sp)   - beginning of 20-byte buffer to hold intermediate result
 #
 # output parameters:
 #
 #	the particular input operation (addpx or subpx) is completed in
 #	this routine. see the routine headers for the four routines that
 #	request addition or subtraction for a list of output parameters
 #	from this routine.
 #
 # algorithm for choice of sign:
 #
 #	the choice of sign for the output string is not nearly so 
 #	straightforward as it is in the case of addition. one approach that is 
 #	often taken is to make a reasonable guess at the sign of the result. 
 #	if the final subtraction causes a borrow, then the choice was incorrect. 
 #	the sign must be changed and the result must be replaced by its tens 
 #	complement.
 #
 #	this routine does not guess. instead, it chooses the input string of 
 #	the larger absolute magnitude as the minuend for this internal 
 #	routine and chooses its sign as the sign of the result.
 #	this algorithm is actually more efficient than the reasonable 
 #	guess method and is probably better than a guess method that is never 
 #	wrong. all complete bytes that are processed in the sign evaluation 
 #	preprocessing loop are eliminated from consideration in the 
 #	subtraction loop, which has a higher cost per byte.
 #
 #	the actual algorithm is as follows. (note that both input strings have 
 #	already had leading zeros stripped so their lengths reflect 
 #	significant digits.)
 #
 #	1.  if the two strings have unequal lengths, then choose the sign of 
 #	    the string that has the longer length.
 #
 #	2.  for strings of equal length, choose the sign of the string whose 
 #	    most significant byte is larger in magnitude.
 #
 #	3.  if the most significant bytes test equal, then decrease the 
 #	    lengths of each string by one byte, drop the previous most 
 #	    significant bytes, and go back to step 2.
 #
 #	4.  if the two strings test equal, it is not necessary to do any 
 #	    subtraction. the result is identically zero.
 #
 #	note that the key to this routine's efficiency is that high order 
 #	bytes that test equal in this loop are dropped from consideration in 
 #	the more complicated subtraction loop.

 # functional description:
 #
 #	this routine takes a packed decimal string that typically contains
 #	the result of an arithmetic operation and stores it in another
 #	decimal string whose descriptor is specified as an input parameter 
 #	to the original arithmetic operation.
 #
 #	the string is stored from the high address end (least significant
 #	digits) to the low address end (most significant digits). this order
 #	allows all of the special cases to be handled in the simplest fashion.
 #
 # input parameters:
 #
 #	r1      - address one byte beyond high address end of input string
 #		  (note that this string must be at least 17 bytes long.)
 #
 #	r4<4:0> - number of digits in ultimate destination
 #	r5      - address one byte beyond destination string
 #
 #       r11     - contains saved condition codes
 #
 # implicit input:
 #
 #	the input string must be at least 17 bytes long to contain a potential
 #	carry out of the highest digit when doing an add of two large numbers. 
 #	this carry out of the last byte will be detected and reported as a 
 #	decimal overflow, either as an exception or simply by setting the v-bit.
 #
 #	the least significant digit (highest addressed byte) cannot contain a
 #	sign digit because that would cause the z-bit to be incorrectly cleared.
 #
 # output parameters:
 #
 #	r11<psl$v_z> - cleared if a nonzero digit is stored in output string
 #	r11<psl$v_v> - set if a nonzero digit is detected after the output
 #		       string is exhausted
 #
 #	a portion of the result (dictated by the size of r4 on input) is
 #	moved to the destination string.

 #
 #	the  multiplicand  string  specified  by  the  multiplicand  length  and
 #	multiplicand  address  operands  is  multiplied by the multiplier string
 #	specified by the multiplier length and multiplier address operands.  the
 #	product  string  specified  by  the  product  length and product address
 #	operands is replaced by the result.
 #
 # input parameters:
 #
 #	r0 - mulrlen.rw		number of digits in multiplier string
 #	r1 - mulraddr.ab	address of multiplier string
 #	r2 - muldlen.rw		number of digits in multiplicand string
 #	r3 - muldaddr.ab	address of multiplicand string
 #	r4 - prodlen.rw		number of digits in product string
 #	r5 - prodaddr.ab	address of product string
 #
 # output parameters:
 #
 #	r0 = 0
 #	r1 = address of the byte containing the most significant digit of
 #	     the multiplier string
 #	r2 = 0
 #	r3 = address of the byte containing the most significant digit of
 #	     the multiplicand string
 #	r4 = 0
 #	r5 = address of the byte containing the most significant digit of
 #	     the string containing the product
 #
 # condition codes:
 #
 #	n <- product string lss 0
 #	z <- product string eql 0
 #	v <- decimal overflow
 #	c <- 0
 #
 # register usage:
 #
 #	this routine uses all of the general registers. the condition codes
 #	are computed at the end of the instruction as the final result is
 #	stored in the product string. r11 is used to record the condition
 #	codes.
 #
 # notes:
 #
 #    1.	this routine uses a large amount of stack space to allow storage of
 #	intermediate results in a convenient form. specifically, each digit
 #	pair of the longer input string is stored in binary in a longword on
 #	the stack. in addition, 32 longwords are set aside to hold the product
 #	intermediate result. each longword contains a binary number between 0
 #	and 99. 
 #
 #	after the multiplication is complete. each longword is removed from
 #	the stack, converted to a packed decimal pair, and stored in the
 #	output string. any nonzero cells remaining on the stack after the
 #	output string has been completely filled are the indication of decimal
 #	overflow. 
 #
 #	the purpose of this method of storage is to avoid decimal/binary or
 #	even byte/longword conversions during the calculation of intermediate
 #	results. 
 #
 #    2.	trailing zeros are removed from the larger string. all zeros in
 #	the shorter string are eliminated in the sense that no arithmetic
 #	is performed. the output array pointer is simply advanced to point
 #	to the next higher array element.

 # notes:
 #
 #	the choice of a longword array to store the auotient deserves a 
 #	comment. in vax$mulp, a longword array was used because its elements 
 #	were used directly by mulp and divp instructions. the use of longwords 
 #	eliminated the need to convert back and forth between longwords and 
 #	bytes. in this routine, the quotient_digit routine returns its result 
 #	in a register, which result can easily be stored in whatever way is 
 #	convenient. by using longwords instead of bytes, this routine can use 
 #	the same end processing code as mulp, a sizeable savings in code.

 #	this routine multiplies an array of numbers (each array element lequ 
 #	99) by a number (also lequ 99). each array element in the input array
 #	is replaced with the modified product, with the carry propogated to
 #	the next array element.
 #
 # input parameters:

 #
 # output parameters:

 # side effects:

 #
 #	r0, r1, and r2 are used as scratch registers. r0 and r1 contain the

 # assumptions:
 #
 #	this routine assumes that all array elements lie in the range from 0

 #	decimal digits.) the arithmetic performed by this routine will
 #	maintain this assumption. the details of this argument can be found in
